Summon items require a linked .animation file with a "use" sound defined. A basic one with the "use" sound defined as the Terraria boss summon sound is at /animations/items/summonitem.animation
Properties for summon items:
"monster" - What monster type to spawn.
"spawnOffset" - Spawn position offset. Defaults to [0, 0], changing recommended as this offset leads inside the player.
"spawnLevel" - Level for monster that spawns.
